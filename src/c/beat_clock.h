/*
 * Beat clock: turns a measured beat interval into beats placed on a wall clock.
 *
 * The trace advances one pixel per fixed slice of time, and a beat can only start on such a
 * pixel. Callers drive it from their render loop:
 *
 *     uint32_t steps = beat_clock_begin(&clock, now_ms());
 *     for (uint32_t i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
 *       bool audible;
 *       if (beat_clock_step(&clock, &audible)) { ... start a beat ... }
 *       ... advance the trace by one pixel ...
 *     }
 *
 * Everything is integer arithmetic on millisecond timestamps that may wrap, and there are no
 * Pebble dependencies, so the logic can be exercised by tools/test_beat_clock.c on a host.
